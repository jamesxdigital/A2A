## Image Generation Prompt

**Prompt for Infographic:**
```
Create a sophisticated network diagram showing 7 interconnected AI agents in a circular formation around a central hub labeled "A2A Protocol". Each agent should be represented as a modern, glowing hexagonal node with distinct colors: Currency (gold), Image (purple), Expense (green), YouTube (red), Travel (blue), Contact (orange), Data (teal). Show flowing data streams between all agents with animated-style arrows. Include vendor logos subtly: Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, MindsDB. Add floating icons around the network: dollar signs, images, charts, videos, planes, contacts, databases. Use a dark background with bright, professional colors. Title: "Multi-Agent AI Ecosystem" at the top. Make it look futuristic and enterprise-ready.
